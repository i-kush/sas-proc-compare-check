# Disclaimer

**This one is something from my good old days** - many years ago I've started working with java only to be able
to comfortably parse outputs of the SAS program.

Of course, I would reconsider a lot of things done here :)

This util is a desktop application on plain java to check output/outputs of the proc compare SAS-procedure on "clearness".

As result of the check will be produced excel-file with the detailed info about outputs and its status - "Passed" or "Failed".

# Requirements

- java 8
- initially it wasn't wrapped with gradle, but I added it just to have modern approach and comfortability
- jar includes dependencies, so it's ready to just be used
